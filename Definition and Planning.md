# Project phase 1 - Definition and planning

A Browser based, fast-paced dungeon crawling game. Player character can move around, attack enemies, gain experience, level up and find items that further enhances the player character. Dungeons are randomly generated and divided into floors where the monsters get tougher the further you play. Seed value used to generate the dungeon is stored in a database with unique id. When the player dies, a link is generated that can be shared with other players. This way other players can attempt to beat the same dungeon and find the previous players corpse, that they can then loot for items they had on them when they died.
