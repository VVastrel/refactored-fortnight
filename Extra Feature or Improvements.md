# Phase 3 – Extra Feature or Improvements (Optional)

## 🎯 Chosen Use Case or Feature to Improve


We decided to fully implement features we had planned, but did not have time to implement before the previous deadline.

## 🔍 Original Definition


"As the player defeats enemies, they gain experience points and once they've accumulated enough, they'll level up and their stats grow"

"With every level up, the amount of experience points needed for the next level up gets larger. Harder enemies also give out more experience points so overall the pacing of level ups should remain smooth."

## 🔄 Implementation


Firstly, the randomly generated rooms were implemented that weren't fully in place yet, and then made it so that the enemies spawn randomly around the map when the player enters. Stairs that take the player to a new generated map with new, more powerful, randomly placed enemies were also added. Player can also now gain experience points that eventually make them stronger.
All of these features were planned for and partly implemented already so all that had to be done was to add them to the game.
