## üìù Project overview


Fast-paced dungeon crawler built with Javascript and React, while utilizing SQL tables. Players explore randomly generated dungeons, fight varies types of enemies, gain experience points, level up and find new gear. Dungeons scale up in difficulty  as the player progresses through the floors of the dungeon, and there's even some harder boss monsters to encounter. The game has a mechanic that records the place of death and gear the player had, and lets spits out a link that player can then share with someone else. That someone can then find the corpse and gear of that player, and be more equipped to handle the challenges ahead. Our target audience is anyone who needs to waste a few minutes, but you can also play for extended sessions like for example when you're passing through diamonds in the toilet.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical implementation

The game is built using JavaScript for core gameplay logic and mechanics. React is used to break the game down into modular pieces that are easy to modify without breaking something else. SQL handles backend storage for player information and dungeon seeds. HTML and CSS are used for visually styling the game and bringing in 2D assets.

## üöÇ Development process

At first we created a sort of mock-up of the game only using Javascript, CSS and HMTL canvas, and thought that it would be easy to bring that to React and separate it into modular pieces. It wasn't and converting proved to be a relatively huge undertaking. Once converted the project became easy to manage so there's no real issues after that since we're really just following the original plan we have for the project.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and future work

As stated before we underestimated the amount of work it would be to make a game in React, but once everything was set up, it was easy to actually work on adding more features and visuals. Once we had an issue near the beginning of the project where both of us were working on large commits at the same time and that caused issues when merging those together. In the future if we continue working on this project, we'll most likely make a version that runs native on windows and linux. That would allow us to spend more time making a more feature rich game.
