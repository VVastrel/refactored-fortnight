## 📝 Project overview


Fast-paced dungeon crawler built with Javascript and React, while utilizing SQL tables. Players explore randomly generated dungeons, fight varies types of enemies, gain experience points, level up and find new gear. Dungeons scale up in difficulty  as the player progresses through the floors of the dungeon, and there's even some harder boss monsters to encounter. The game has a mechanic that records the place of death and gear the player had, and lets spits out a link that player can then share with someone else. That someone can then find the corpse and gear of that player, and be more equipped to handle the challenges ahead. Our target audience is anyone who needs to waste a few minutes, but you can also play for extended sessions like for example when you're passing through diamonds in the toilet.
